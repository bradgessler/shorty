= TODO
Some stuff that I might do if I get around to it (in no particular order).

 * JSON API - Build an API so people can plug these URL minifiers into their preferred services.
 * Make all of the text boxes size to the contents in them.
 * Get read of the difference between new and show; AJAXify the whole damn thing with jquery.
 * Look at ditching more of the gem dependencies to make this more portable.
 * Write some tests around this whole thing.
 * Publish the JSON API as a microformat for all URL shortening services to adopt.
 * Get some app developers to adopt this format so folks can drop in their own URL shortening service.
